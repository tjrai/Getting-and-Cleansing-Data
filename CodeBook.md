Data for the project :
“https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip”

Data provided are as below:

- X_train.txt: Training set
- y_train.txt: Training labels
- X_test.txt: Test set
- y_test.txt: Test labels
- subject_train.txt/subject_test.txt:  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- features.text: List of all features
- activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name

Variables:

trainX : reads the X_train.txt data
trainy: reads the y_train.txt data
trainsubj: reads the subject_train.txt data
testX: reads the X_test.txt data
testy: reads the y_test.txt data
testsubj: reads the subject_test.txt data
mergeX : stores the merged test and training sets together
mergey: stores the merged test and training labels together
feature data: reads features.txt data
mergeSubj: stores the subject test and training data together
activitydata : reads features.txt data
activitylbl: Applies activity names to the merged test and training labels
Dataset: Combines all the merged test, train and subject data together
measureextract: finds the indices of the features of mean() and std() from feature data
cleandata: creates a data frame with only mean() and std() measurements
along with activity and subject
tidydata: creates another data table of cleandata
averagedata: calculates the average/mean of tidydata i.e for each measurement for each subject and each activity

Transformations:

- converts the names of features in lower case
- assigns the column names in the merged train and test set with the features names
from features.txt data which have mean() and std() measurements
- assigns the column names in the merged train and test labels with “activity” and “description”
- assigns the column name in the merged train and test subjects with “subject”
- extracts only the mean() and std() measurements from features data
- removes the ‘()’ from mean and std measurements names
- removes the ‘_’ from the activity description names
